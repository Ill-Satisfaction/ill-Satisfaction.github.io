        <h2>Puppet Knight</h2>
        <p>Solo Project</p>
        <p><strong>Spring 2020 - Spring 2022</strong></p>
        <p>
            Puppet Knight is a short VR experience that explores the concept of
            depersonalization. It features a unique physics-based method of movement
            in VR, as well as IK animations. It uses what were at the time experimental
            Unity packages to deliver a truly unique experience.

        <ul class="list">
            <li>Designed and prototyped a physics-based movement mechanic for VR with the then-experimental Animation-Rigging package</li>

            <li>Concepted and built out rudimentary design elements</li>

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>
            I am very fond of Puppet Knight; it was my first more independant 
            code project.
            However, I made some serious mistakes with its development:
        </p>

        <strong>I should test sooner and more often</strong><br />
        <p>
            As a new developer doing
            something without tutorials, I overcommitted to design choices before
            sufficient testing. 
           
            In future projects, I adopted a strategy of slower, more deliberate 
            developement:
            paying close attention to whether or not a mechanic meets design goals
            at each step of the way.
        </p>

        <strong>I need to be critical about which features to include</strong><br />
        <p>
            As a game, Puppet Knight was a failure. As a short novel VR experience, I
            think it succeeded. This is because I spent nearly all of my development
            time on the IK walking system. If I wanted to make a game instead of a
            short non-game, I would have had to prioritize more fiercely and possibly
            I wouldn't have completed the IK walk system at all. While I was free to not do that
            for this project, it is something to keep in mind on projects with more
            clear outcomes requirements.
        </p>
