<h5>overview</h5>
<p>
    Exploratory work on bringing scent into VR for use in therapy for 
    Alzheimers and dementia. Built with
    Unity C#, Arduino, and custom hardware.

        <h6 style="text-align:center;">my role</h6>
        <p>
            I got the opportunity to work with the Boise State VARScent team for the 
            summer of my sophomore year of college. 
		    I worked as solo dev doing work in Unity C# and Arduino Code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team had already created an arduino solution to run their poprietary hardware, 
            which could be attached to the front of a VR headset (shown above). What they did 
            not have at this point was a way to integrate that hardware into a VR experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage of my VR journey, I wasn't really an expert in what I was doing, so it
            took me some time to research possible solutions. I stumbled on a package for Unity
            called Ardity, which did 90% of what I needed. So I built an implementation using
            Ardity and re-wrote the existing Arduino code in order to make them work together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I put together a little demo to show the non-software-aligned stakeholders
            what had been accomplished. At that point, I was just about out of summertime, so I 
            took my leave from the group in order to continue learning in other areas.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h6 style="text-align:center;">what we did</h6>
        <p>
            VARScent is a very exploratory project on the Boise State campus and is not 
            (at the time that I wrote this) putting foward any finished projects for the public 
            to see. I'm not sure how
            much I can say about the inner workings of their hardware, so I'll err on the side of 
            caution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stated goals of VARscent is to build tools for therapies for dementia and alzheimers.
            The ability to bring scent into VR is a powerful tool for these and other applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Altogether, working with the VARscent group was a great opportunity to
            work on a novel problem, learn a lot, and make something that perhaps hadn't been made 
            before.
