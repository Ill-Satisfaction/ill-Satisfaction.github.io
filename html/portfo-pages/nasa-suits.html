        <p><strong>Winter 2021 - Summer 2022</strong></p>
        <p>
            SUITS is an annual design challenge hosted by NASA to design
            AR tools for astronauts on EVAs
            <a target="_blank" href="https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/nasasuits">[Link]</a>.
            ARSIS 5.0 was Boise State's contribution for the 2021-2022 challenge.

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <p>
            My time at SUITS is something I remember fondly; it was the first large
            project that I worked in, and the first serious team that I led. As such
            I made plenty of mistakes and learned a lot:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I should delegate more</strong><br />
            Many of my failures came from taking on too much and not relying enough on those
            around me. This current iteration of the project, ARSIS 6.0, I’ve distributed my
            old role among team members in preparation for my graduation. I’m also paying more
            attention to how I might be underutilizing my team.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I need to be better about project scope.</strong> <br />

            Due to Covid and some untimely graduations, we were
            operating with a very small team for 5.0. I need to be better at prioritizing features
            and project scope in order to properly lead teams of any size. This year we've recruited
            a larger team, but I'm still keeping my eye on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I need to recognize setbacks sooner and take the initiative.</strong> <br />

            We lost a lot of development time due to bureaucratic concerns. Eventually I realized that
            they wouldn't get resolved through the university and worked around it, but I could have saved
            significant resources by doing that earlier.
        </p>

        <h2>What we did</h2>
        <p>
            SUITS has three main goals during a project: submit a design proposal to NASA, perform outreach
            to the community, and prototype Augmented Reality tools for astronauts. During the 2021-2022
            year, we largely succeeded on the first two counts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote the majority of a proposal that was accepted by NASA, and it recieved some praise
            for clarity. Additionally, it was useful for onboarding new members and telling them about
            the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            We published papers, coordinated with the
            Discovery Center of Idaho, and otherwise were able to help people understand more about
            NASA, AR, and SUITS. Additionally, we were able to recruit a sufficient team to be well equipped
            for the 2022-2023 year, despite operating at severely reduced efficacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, due to several challenges that I'll get into below, we made a poor showing that
            year. Brutal scope cutting and intense crunching were required to have a project to show NASA
            at all.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <h4>Reduced team size due to Covid 19.</h4>
        <p>
            Covid
            safety measures hit all student involvement groups hard, and our research group was no exception.
            We had a significantly reduced team size compared to previous years.
        </p><p>
            Our team had to prioritize recruitment over development, and there was a larger-than-usual
            push for outreach that year. I was personally responsible for bringing two new people onto the
            team, but they were unable to join until the next project (ARSIS 6.0).
        </p>
        <h4>Bureaucratic troubles with version control.</h4>
        <p>
            When our old version control solution—Unity Collab—was decommissioned, we were not able to
            switch to its replacement due to its subscription-based payment model. We lost the bulk of our
            development time to this issue, and eventually I bit the bullet and bought a few months for
            the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, I began an sub-project to switch ARSIS from the old singleton design pattern
            to an observer-based pattern. This should add modularity and enable us to use Github to manage
            our solution. If successful, we should avoid future reliance on paid VCS solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>No original team members.</h4>
        <p>
            2022 was the first year after the last member of the original SUITS Challenge Team graduated.
            While I had spearheaded an effort to document everything we could in advance of her graduation,
            it was still difficult operating without that guidance.
