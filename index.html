                                studio. Once embedded, Akiah didn't just meet expectations, they redefined them. They
                                took on additional responsibilities, demonstrated solid coding skills, and created a QA
                                tool that became invaluable to Game Design. This tool leveraged backend playtest data to
                                generate an overlay onto the current game level visualizing every player death: where it
                                occurred, where the fatal shot originated, and the method of death. By providing clear
                                insights into engagement zones, chokepoints, and level flow, Akiah‚Äôs work gave designers
                                insightful data to help them refine maps and optimize gameplay. </p>
                            <p>Beyond technical expertise, Akiah has the ability to bridge gaps between teams, QA,
                                Engineering, UI, and Game Design; ensuring that testing isn't just about finding bugs
                                but about elevating the entire game. Any team would be lucky to have them.

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In 2023, I had just finished my part of coding for a stealth B2B app startup and decided that,
                        with Covid-19 no longer the dominant concern, it was time for me to get a real job. I had been
                        an advocate for games since I was a little kid, and got a degree in Game Development not long
                        earlier, so I decided that it was a good time to try for it. Unfortunately, Games is something
                        of a insider industry-- so I figured my best shot was to get a basic Games Tester position and
                        work my way up.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, that's what I did.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward a year, and an opportunity opened up for a tester to be embedded in an STE role at
                        NeonMachine: the creators of the high-profile crypto game Shrapnel. I had worked hard the year
                        prior to make sure that I was well-positioned for a promotion: I had lept into action previously
                        in learning the ropes so that I could onboard and support new testers, and took point on special
                        projects whenever they were available (or whenever I noticed that it would be helpful to start
                        one). I was given the chance to move to Seattle and take on the role.</p>
                    <p>While working as an STE, my focus continued to be on team support roles, including writing lots
                        of tests and documentation, mentoring, and speaking directly to the designers and developers to
                        determine the current state and requirements of the game. Additionally, I took over a lot of the
                        CI/CD requirements of my team, including launching servers, tracking server-side logs and
                        crashes, verifying VCS commits, and staying on top of the State-of-the-Project from a QA
                        perspective.
                        I was also given some opportunities to get back into coding, and built a visualizer tool for the
                        designers. I of course scrubbed out all the company-specific info, but I was given permission to
                        show the anonymized version of the app below ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
                    <div class="img-caption-wrapper">
                        <img class="img-regular" src="img/shrapnel/shrapnel-visualizer-tool.png"
                            alt="visualizer tool with random map background and data" />

                    </div>

                    <p>Unfortunately, Games is also a turbulent industry. After supporting three live releases of the
                        Shrapnel Game, enjoyed by many live players (specific numbers would likely breach my NDA üòâ), I,
                        and the rest of my team, were reassigned or let go. I was given the choice to move back to
                        Idaho, but decided that I liked Seattle too much to do that.</p>

                    <p>Overall, I'm proud of the work that I did, happy with the people I met, and glad for the
                        experience üòÅ
                    </p>
