        <h2>Dino Wars</h2>
        <p>Designer, Primary Developer</p>
        <p><strong>Winter 2021</strong></p>
        <p>
            Dino Wars is a multiplayer tower builder/demolisher microgame
            inspired by Angry Birds.
            It uses 3d models and networked physics to allow one player to build towers
            and another to knock them down.

        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>

        <strong>I should pay more attention to software architecture</strong><br />
        <p>
            This was the project that really taught me the importance of software
            architecture. I made some pretty serious mistakes early on that required
            me to refactor most of the code. This drove me to do a bunch more research
            into scaleability and architecture for networked systems.
        </p>

        <strong>I should be aware of what I can do easily and what is new to me</strong><br />
        <p>
            I had to learn a lot for this project. It was my most complete game
            at that time, as well as dove into completely new territory (multiplayer).
            As a result of my approach to the project, I had a huge crunch period at
            the end—culminating in two weeks where I published over 800 lines of code. This
            was a lot for me at the time, although it is less now. In order to smooth out
            the workflow more in future projects, I try to keep a mental list of everything
            that I need to learn for a project. This lets me work on sections while still
            internalizing info that is needed for other sections later down the line.
