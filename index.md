# Under Construction!

## Summary

Welcome to my quick-and-dirty portfolio! please don't mind the mess. 

Im a Senior GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile) Student at Boise State University, with a minor in Computer Science, and a business fundamentals certificate from Harvard Business School Online. I'm mostly into XR (mostly tools, but games too!), but have done my fair share of android development, graphic design, 3d design, java programing, database work, UI, customer service, and management.

My career goals are to build tools to improve telepresence and personal autonomy. That said, I'm down to do anything cool with tech, and to learn along the way!
