                                but about elevating the entire game. Any team would be lucky to have them.

                    <p>In 2023, I had just finished my part of coding for a stealth B2B app startup and decided that,
                        with Covid-19 no longer the dominant concern, it was time for me to get a real job. I had been
                        an advocate for games since I was a little kid, and got a degree in Game Development not long
                        earlier, so I decided that it was a good time to try for it. Unfortunately, Games is something
                        of a insider industry-- so I figured my best shot was to get a basic Games Tester position and
                        work my way up.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, that's what I did.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward a year, and an opportunity opened up for a tester to be embedded in an STE role at
                        NeonMachine: the creators of the high-profile crypto game Shrapnel. I had worked hard the year
                        prior to make sure that I was well-positioned for a promotion: I had lept into action previously
                        in learning the ropes so that I could onboard and support new testers, and took point on special
                        projects whenever they were available (or whenever I noticed that it would be helpful to start
                        one). I was given the chance to move to Seattle and take on the role. After a lot of anxiety and
                        considerations, I flew across state lines with just a backpack and a dream.</p>
                    <p>While working as an STE, my focus continued to be on team support roles, including writing lots
                        of tests and documentation, mentoring, and speaking directly to the designers and developers to
                        determine the current state and requirements of the game. Additionally, I took over a lot of the
                        CI/CD requirements of my team, including launching servers, tracking server-side logs and
                        crashes, verifying VCS commits, and staying on top of the State-of-the-Project from a QA
                        perspective.
                        I was also given some opportunities to get back into coding, and built a visualizer tool for the
                        designers. I of course scrubbed out all the company-specific info, but I was given permission to
                        show the anonymized version of the app below ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Unfortunately, Games is also a turbulent industry. After supporting three live releases of the
                        Shrapnel Game, enjoyed by many live players (specific numbers would likely breach my NDA üòâ), I,
                        and the rest of my team, were reassigned or let go. I was given the choice to move back to
                        Idaho, but decided that I liked Seattle too much to do that.</p>

                    <p>Overall, I'm proud of the work that I did, happy with the people I met, and glad for the
                        experience üòÅ

                    <p>A number of years ago, in 2019, I was invited to join an on-campus research group exploring XR UI
                        features with NASA. At the time I was working on a degree in Games Development. Ironically,
                        between SUITs and VARScent, I spent more time in that degree doing useful research than making
                        games. Still, though, NASA Sounded awesome and VR was the hot new thing, so I dove into it</p>

                    <p>In my first year on the project, I built navigation tools in C#. A lot of videogame features were
                        untested in VR, so we went about testing them. My personal feature was the 'Beacons' feature and
                        the 'Minimap' function. Between these two features, you could look out over terrain and see
                        points of interest through walls or other obstacles, as well as navigate to them from far away
                        with a heading and a distance. You can see both features in this video that we took during some
                        outreach at my university:</p>

                    <p>After my first year on the project, I was asked to take over as Team Lead. This was a very
                        educational position for me, because it gave me my first real chance to practice the Project
                        Management skills that the C.S. degree taught in their "Agile" class. I also was able to put my
                        design experience from my Highschool internship into use, leading design discussions with team
                        members to meet NASA challenge requirements, as well as personally writing the majority of a 30
                        page technical research proposal, which was accepted by NASA and the Idaho Space Grant
                        Consortium and allowed the team to perform the work (below).</p>

                        that objective. The SUITs Challenge team is still around today and operational. Our secondary
                        objectives of trying new things in XR, presenting them to NASA, and performing outreach and
                        academic papers, were also all successful to varying degrees. We discovered a lot more 'it
                        doesn't works's than 'it works's, but, hey, that's research!

                        After my year as Team Lead, and a bonus semester to get some ducks in a row with my Major switch
                        from Computer Science to Games, I graduated, and left the position for another Undergraduate
                        Researcher to fill.

                        Overall, I really enjoy my time with SUITs. It was a lot of work, and a lot
                        of learning. Everything XR was back then, because the field was so new, and we were all
                        undergrads. I remember the switch
                        from MRTK 2 to 3 throwing our team into disarray until we could adapt, and figuring out how to
                        do checkins for GitHub (to avoid the large binary file problem) was its own adventure üòÜ
