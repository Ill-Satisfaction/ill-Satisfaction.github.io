<h5>overview</h5>
<p>
    Long-term personal VR project involving multiple experimental packages. Spans 
    from concepting to design to Unity components to custom programming.

    <p>
        Life is an immersive medium. It is not an uncommon
        belief among philosophers and religionists that the physical world is
        just an abstraction or an illusion, and that people are tricked into thinking that 
        it is real.
    </p>
    <p>

        VR is similarly immersive. It is easy to forget, for a moment, that you
        are not really in that space. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started Puppet Knight back in 2020, I wanted to explore this parallel. 
        What does it mean to be immersed? how can we fight that immersion to create a sort of
        'dissociation' in a VR environment? I have, at times in my life, experienced derealization,
        and wanted to explore it in an artistic medium.
    </p>
    <p>
        I came to the conclusion that a good method for this expression would be a 3rd-person game.
        How does a 3rd-person game work in VR? I could go with a classic implementation, a la 
        'Trover Saves the Universe' but I was afraid that that would come too naturally. 
        Routine, I felt, did not lead to this disconnect between the person and the personage that 
        I wanted. I came to think about puppets, and how they are representative of our aims (they
        are used in puppet shows as actors, for example) but are not us. Rather, we have to move them
        through another medium (strings, hand guestures, etc). This seemed fitting.
     </p>
     <p>
        I was going to make a game about
        puppets.
    </p>

    <h6 style="text-align:center;">asset creation</h6>
    <p>
        The first step for a project like this was creating the assets that would be used in the final
        game. I spent a lot of time concepting the various appearances of the puppet, as well as
        NPCs to interact with. This stage was pretty cut-and-dry, and I've posted some of my favorite
        pieces as 'chapter headers' of sorts for the early stages of development.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the concept art was made, I jumped on 3D modeling in Blender. This has a very 
        steep learning curve for me, and I am still not happy with my level of proficiency in this
        area. After I had the models rigged, I imported them into Unity to begin what would become
        the most involved project that I had ever worked on at the time of this writing.
    </p>

    <h6 style="text-align:center;">implementation</h6>
    <p>
        When I began this project, I had the idea to make a game where you move the character by
        physically pushing them around in VR. I did not realize, at this stage of my game-making
        career, how ridiculously hard that is to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first forrays into this field were with Unity's ragdolls. My idea was to attach spring 
        joint to a physics-enabled ragdoll in order to make a 'punching bag' of sorts. This lead to
        an interesting effect, but not one that I wanted. The animations lacked intention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar low-effort efforts were similarly ineffective. I had to face the truth: I had to learn 
        what I was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the course of my journey, I learned about cross-products, raycasts, inverse kinematics,
        shaders (incidental), Unity physics, a little about quaternions, and a lot about programming in the Unity
        environment. The irony was not lost on me that, in the course of making a game about
        exploring an unfamiliar environment, I was doing just that.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, I used Unity's animation-rigging package (which was experiemental when I began),
        a configurable joint,
        and a bunch of code I wrote to manage the movement of the puppet. My initial goal was finally
        complete: A player could  push a
        puppet in order to move themselves around a VR environment.
    </p>

    <h6 style="text-align:center;">conclusion</h6>

    <p>
        This project has been very involved. I tried to do everything myself, and learned a lot 
        about all sorts of parts of the game-making process. Taking a project from one end to the
        other, accepting my mistakes, and learning along the way has been an eye opening experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to continue development on puppet knight. In it's current state, it is obviously unfinished.
        I have a lot of ideas for where it could go from here, and will make good on as many as I can
        over the years. However, I think that I'll forgo my requirement that I do everything myself.
        Although I learned a lot in fields like 3D modeling, I also learned that there are areas that
        my projects could benefit from collaborating with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, that's what I wanted to say about this topic. If you are curious about this project (or
        most anything else) feel free to reach out! Otherwise, thanks for listening.
